# Meta Agent


Meta agent designed to generate, evaluate, and select the best-performing agents for your tasks. It produces 16 candidate "probes," scores them based on customizable evaluation metrics, and identifies the optimal agent configuration.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Describe your desired agent in plain English, and Meta Agent will translate it into a functional agent.
- **Agent Generation**: Automatically builds 16 unique agent "probes" with varied configurations.
- **Evaluation & Scoring**: Scores each probe based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, speed, task completion) and selects the best one.
- **Framework Flexibility**: Built with Pydantic-AI by default, but adaptable to frameworks like AutoGen or crewAI.
- **Extensible**: Easily customize agent roles, tools, and evaluation criteria.
